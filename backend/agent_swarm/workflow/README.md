# Dynamic Workflow Planning and Execution

This module provides dynamic workflow planning and execution capabilities for the DataHammer AI Agent Swarm, using a custom multiagent workflow approach.

## Components

### WorkflowStep

Represents a single step in a workflow, encapsulating:
- The agent responsible for executing the step
- The task to be performed
- Input requirements
- Output specifications
- Dependencies on other steps

### WorkflowGraph

Represents a directed graph of workflow steps, responsible for:
- Storing the workflow steps and their dependencies
- Validating the workflow structure
- Identifying the next steps to execute
- Tracking the execution state

### WorkflowPlanner

Dynamically plans workflows based on user goals and data characteristics, responsible for:
- Analyzing user goals
- Creating a workflow graph of steps
- Determining the optimal sequence of agent invocations
- Adapting the workflow based on intermediate results

### WorkflowExecutor

Executes workflow steps using the appropriate agents, responsible for:
- Executing workflow steps in the correct order
- Managing parallel execution when possible
- Handling step failures and retries
- Updating the environment with step results

## Usage

The workflow module is used by the OrchestratorAgent to dynamically plan and execute workflows based on user goals and data characteristics.

```python
# Initialize the workflow components
workflow_planner = WorkflowPlanner()
workflow_executor = WorkflowExecutor()

# Plan the workflow
workflow = workflow_planner.create_workflow(goals, environment)

# Execute the workflow
updated_env = workflow_executor.execute_workflow(workflow, environment, invoke_agent_fn)
```

## Workflow Planning Process

1. The WorkflowPlanner analyzes the user goals and available agents
2. It creates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of workflow steps
3. Each step is assigned to a specialized agent
4. Dependencies between steps are established
5. The workflow is validated to ensure it's a valid DAG

## Workflow Execution Process

1. The WorkflowExecutor identifies steps that are ready to be executed (all dependencies satisfied)
2. It executes these steps in parallel (up to a configurable limit)
3. As steps complete, their results are added to the environment
4. The executor continues until all steps are completed or failed
5. If a step fails, the executor can retry it (up to a configurable limit)

## Error Handling and Recovery

The workflow system includes error handling and recovery mechanisms:
- Failed steps can be retried automatically
- The WorkflowPlanner can generate recovery plans for failed steps
- The workflow can be replanned if necessary

## Workflow Features

This workflow system includes:
- Agent handoffs for sequential processing
- Specialized agent roles for different tasks
- Dynamic task planning based on goals
